This is based on the BLANK theme by Chris Coyier, as well as a little bit of the Kube and Bootstrap frameworks. The design and functionality are lifted from the Canvass CMS I built (which you can find elsewhere on my GitHub).

##Usage

Included here is the Canvass theme completed for the band Alpha Male Tea Party. The colours used are defined at the top of the stylesheet, so you should be able to just find and replace all of the colours to fit your colour scheme pretty quickly. 

Then all that's left is to size up a logo (320x84) and add your bandcamp embed code into the space on home.php. The squiggly arrow acts as a gutter so you can either use that as a spacer div or add your own content, ditto with the image area on the left of the home page. 

##Notes

&raquo;The 'Gig' link is pointed at Songkick. Obviously if you wanted this contained within the site you'd just create an editable page where you could list gigs.
