This is based on the BLANK theme by Chris Coyier, as well as a little bit of the Kube and Bootstrap frameworks. 

The main layout, styles and functionality are designed to mimic the Canvass CMS I built in PHP. 

If you know your way around the wordpress code it should be a very simple job to jump in and replace all the styles in the layout to end up with a responsive website with wordpress blog, protected press area and public bio - with the latter three editable via the Wordpress CMS.
